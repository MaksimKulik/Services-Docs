# Overview

This section explains how to configure and maintain **Services** in the platform.

A **Service** is a configuration unit that links a selected **Provider** with the required **Credentials** and defines how the platform operates with that provider.

A service configuration determines:

- Which credentials are used for authentication
- Which balances are tracked and in which currencies
- Which fee profiles are applied for calculations and reporting

In most setups, a single provider can have multiple services (for example, to separate environments, regions, merchants, or credential sets).
