# Writing guidelines

## Diagrams and screenshots

Use diagrams and UI screenshots to clarify complex behavior.

Recommended locations:

- `docs/assets/images/diagrams/` — conceptual diagrams
- `docs/assets/images/screens/` — UI screenshots

### Example embed

```html
<img class="doc-image"
     src="assets/images/diagrams/service-relationships.png"
     alt="Service relationships diagram">
